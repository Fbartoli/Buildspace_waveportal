# Buildspace_waveportal

Created with CodeSandbox

Youâ€™ll be building a website that Iâ€™ll be calling the WavePortal â€” itâ€™ll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write from, weâ€™ll talk about this more in a bit).

Youâ€™ll be writing + deploying the smart contract and youâ€™ll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with your smart contract.

Weâ€™re going to make this a little spicy as well â€” basically, when someone waves at you there a random chance they can win a small amount of Ethereum from your site :).

Youâ€™ll be able to customize the website as much as you want. For example:

- Maybe instead of a ðŸ‘‹ you want people to send you a ðŸ’©.
- Perhaps instead of a plain old message, you want them to send you a Spotify link and create a place where anyone can send you awesome music and have it saved.
- You can change the smart contract to recognize when one of your friends is waving at you (based on their Ethereum wallet address) and then take them to a page where they get Rick Rollâ€™d.

You can do whatever you want :).

By the end, youâ€™ll have a site you can show off and actually have people use. Your fellow classmates will be your first users!
